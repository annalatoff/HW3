# This script is a fufillment of the Final Exam 3           #
# using the data set nola_crime_2018,iris, mtcars           #
# It requires the use of readr and ggplot2 as well as the   # 
# r markdown, tidyverse, and knitr packages                 #
# It was developed in R 3.6.1                               #

#it is up to you if you want to keep the view command in your code but it is not necessary to include it (most people don't include this in their code); for question #5 where you also have the view command, it was helpful to include here because you created table values and not objects as you did here in question 3 (for question 3 since you created an object, whoever is reading your code can access the object from the global environment to view the data)

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
